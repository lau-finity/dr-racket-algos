Displaying a thorough understanding of a functional language
Here you find different programs which are seperated into 10 different categories that focus entirely on the topic:

- 01. general syntax 
- 02. conditional expressions 
- 03. structures 
- 04. pure structural recursion
- 05. mix of structural, accumulative, and generative recursion
- 06. review of structures and recursions in complicated lists
- 07. binary search trees: manipulating key, values
- 08. introduction to local definitions 
- 09. local, lambda, abstract list functions
- 10. quicksort, bubblesort

NOTE: Every program definition follows a strict design recipe for function readability:
     (purpose, contract, requirements, examples, and tests)
